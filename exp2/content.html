                            Metacentre is the theoretical point at which an imaginary vertical line passing through the centre of buoyancy
                            and centre of gravity intersects the imaginary vertical line through a new centre of buoyancy created when the body
                             is displaced, or tipped, in the water, however little.<br>

                              <img src="../images/metacentre_1.PNG"width="50" height"50"><br><br>

                            A body in static equilibrium is acted by two forces Centre of buoyancy( Fb) acting through center of pressure and force
                            of gravity (W) acting through center of gravity which are equal in magnitude.
                            If body is given small angular displacement the left side of body get more immersed than left hand side and hence center
                            of buoyancy get shifted to new position. As the fluid displaced on the right side is more now force of buoyancy acts
                            through new shifted position of center of buoyancy.. In this experiment it is assumed that position of center of gravity
                            remains the same relative to body. Now if vertical line is drawn through the new center of buoyancy B1 then it intersects
                            the body BG at point M which is called as Metacenter of the body.<br><br>

                            Thus metacentre for a floating body may be defined as the point of intersection between the axis of the floating body <br>
                            passing through the points B and G and a vertical line passing through the new centre of buoyancy B1. For small values <br>
                            of the angle of heel θ, the position of the metacentre M is practically constant. Further the distance between the centre <br>
                            of gravity G and the metacentre M of a floating body (i.e., GM ) as θ → 0, is known as metacentric height. <br>

                             buoy each other—in other words, the effective centre of the displaced water. The metacentre remains
                             directly above the centre of buoyancy regardless of the tilt of a floating body, such as a ship.
                             When at rest on even keel, the vessel’s centre of buoyancy is directly below the centre of gravity
                             as well as below the metacentre. (The centre of gravity is the point in a body about which all
                             parts of the body balance each other.) When a vessel tilts, one side displaces more water than
                             does the other, and the centre of buoyancy moves and is no longer directly under the centre of
                             gravity, but, regardless of the amount of the tilt, the centre of buoyancy remains directl
                             below the metacentre. If the metacentre is above the centre of gravity, buoyancy restores stability
                             when the ship tilts. The stability increases with the distance between metacentre and centre of gravity
                             , called the metacentric height. If the metacentre is below the centre of gravity, the boat is unstable,
                             and a tilt results in capsizing.<br><br>

                            <b> Methods to find metacentric height of body</b><br>
                             There are two methods which may be used to determine the metacentric height of a floating body.<br>
                             (i)	Theoretical Method.<br>
                            (ii)	Experimental Method for the Determination of the Metacentric Height.<br><br>

                            <b>	Experimental Method for the Determination of the Metacentric Height.</b><br><br>
                            Let us consider a ship (or a boat) floating in water. Let w be a movable weight placed centrally
                            on the deck of the ship and W be the total weight of the ship including w. It is assumed that the
                            ship is initially in equilibrium, so that the deck is horizontal. Now the weight w is moved
                            transversely through a distance x across the deck, so that the ship tilts through a small angle θ,
                            and comes to rest in a new position of equilibrium. The angle θ may be measured by noting the
                           horizontal distance moved by a long plumb line or a pendulum, hanging inside the ship from the centre
                           point of the deck, on a horizontal scale.<br>

                             <img src="../images/metacentre_expt1.PNG"width="50" height"50"><br><br>

                           Even if body is tilted center of buoyancy and center of  gravity will remain in  same vertical line.
                           The movement of the weight w through a distance x causes a parallel shift of the total centre of gravity
                            (that is the centre of gravity of the whole ship including w) from G to G’.

                           Now if l is the length of the plumb line or pendulum and d is the distance moved by it on the horizontal scale then

 Since the point M corresponds to the metacentre for small angles of heel only, the true metacentric height is the limiting value of GM as θ → 0. This may be determined from a graph plotted between the nominal values of GM calculated for various values of θ (both positive and negative) and the angle θ. The metacentric height for a ship or a boat may be determined by the method discussed above only after it has been constructed. But in many cases it is, however, desirable to be able to determine the metacentric height before a ship or a boat has been constructed. In such cases the theoretical method for the determination of the metacentric height, as discussed below, may be adopted.<br>



                           <b>	Theoretical Method for the Determination of the Metacentric Height.</b><br><br>
                           By this method the metacentric height for a ship or a boat may be determined simply by considering its shape.
                           The initial equilibrium position of the ship and at the position of the ship after it has been tilted about the
                           longitudinal axis through a small angle θ is shown in figure. In the tilted position of the ship the portion on
                           the left has emerged from the liquid,<br>

                             <img src="../images/metacentre_theoretical1.PNG"width="50" height"50"><br><br>

                          while the portion on the right has moved down into the liquid. It is assumed that there is no overall vertical movement,
                          thus the vertical equilibrium is not disturbed. The volume immersed in the liquid remains the same as the shape of the
                          body is unaltered and hence force acting on the both sides remain same. This is so if the planes of floatation for the
                          equilibrium and the tilted positions intersect along the centroidal axes of the planes. As the ship is tilted its centre
                          of buoyancy shifts from B to B1 which causes a change in the moment of the buoyant force. Due to change in geometrical
                          shape of the displaced body position of centre of buoyancy gets shifted  by the submergence of the right wedge into the
                          liquid and the emergence of the left wedge from the liquid. These two wedges may represent respectively a positiand
                          negative buoyant force which form a couple. The effect of this couple must be the same as the change in moment of the
                          buoyant force that is (Fb× BM ×θ) produced by the shift of the total buoyant force Fb.
