                              The centre of buoyancy of a floating body is the point about which all the body parts exactly
                             buoy each other—in other words, the effective centre of the displaced water. The metacentre remains
                             directly above the centre of buoyancy regardless of the tilt of a floating body, such as a ship.
                             When at rest on even keel, the vessel’s centre of buoyancy is directly below the centre of gravity
                             as well as below the metacentre. (The centre of gravity is the point in a body about which all
                             parts of the body balance each other.) When a vessel tilts, one side displaces more water than
                             does the other, and the centre of buoyancy moves and is no longer directly under the centre of
                             gravity, but, regardless of the amount of the tilt, the centre of buoyancy remains directl
                             below the metacentre. If the metacentre is above the centre of gravity, buoyancy restores stability
                             when the ship tilts. The stability increases with the distance between metacentre and centre of gravity
                             , called the metacentric height. If the metacentre is below the centre of gravity, the boat is unstable,
                             and a tilt results in capsizing.

                             Methods to find metacentric height of body<br>
                             There are two methods which may be used to determine the metacentric height of a floating body.<br>
                             (i)	Theoretical Method.<br>
                            (ii)	Experimental Method for the Determination of the Metacentric Height.<br>
                            Let us consider a ship (or a boat) floating in water. Let w be a movable weight placed centrally on the deck of the ship and W be the total weight of the ship including w. It is assumed that the ship is initially in equilibrium, so that the deck is horizontal. Now the weight w is moved transversely through a distance x across the deck, so that the ship tilts through a small angle θ, and comes to rest in a new position of equilibrium. The angle θ may be measured by noting the horizontal distance moved by a long plumb line or a pendulum, hanging inside the ship from the centre point of the deck, on a horizontal scale.

Even if body is tilted center of buoyancy and center of  gravity will remain in  same vertical line. The movement of the weight w through a distance x causes a parallel shift of the total centre of gravity (that is the centre of gravity of the whole ship including w) from G to G’ such that

Now if l is the length of the plumb line or pendulum and d is the distance moved by it on the horizontal scale then

 Since the point M corresponds to the metacentre for small angles of heel only, the true metacentric height is the limiting value of GM as θ → 0. This may be determined from a graph plotted between the nominal values of GM calculated for various values of θ (both positive and negative) and the angle θ. The metacentric height for a ship or a boat may be determined by the method discussed above only after it has been constructed. But in many cases it is, however, desirable to be able to determine the metacentric height before a ship or a boat has been constructed. In such cases the theoretical method for the determination of the metacentric height, as discussed below, may be adopted.
(i)	Theoretical Method for the Determination of the Metacentric Height.
By this method the metacentric height for a ship or a boat may be determined simply by considering its shape. The initial equilibrium position of the ship and at the position of the ship after it has been tilted about the longitudinal axis through a small angle θ is shown in figure. In the tilted position of the ship the portion on the left has emerged from the liquid,


while the portion on the right has moved down into the liquid. It is assumed that there is no overall vertical movement, thus the vertical equilibrium is not disturbed. The volume immersed in the liquid remains the same as the shape of the body is unaltered and hence force acting on the both sides remain same. This is so if the planes of floatation for the equilibrium and the tilted positions intersect along the centroidal axes of the planes. As the ship is tilted its centre of buoyancy shifts from B to B1 which causes a change in the moment of the buoyant force. Due to change in geometrical shape of the displaced body position of centre of buoyancy gets shifted  by the submergence of the right wedge into the liquid and the emergence of the left wedge from the liquid. These two wedges may represent respectively a positive and negative buoyant force which form a couple. The effect of this couple must be the same as the change in moment of the buoyant force that is (Fb× BM ×θ) produced by the shift of the total buoyant force Fb..
