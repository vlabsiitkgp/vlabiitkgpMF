                              The Archimedes principle states that the buoyant force on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the<br>
                              fluid that is displaced by that object. <br>
                            <b>  Buoyancy: </b><br>
                              When a body is immersed in a fluid, an upward force is exerted by the fluid on the body. This upward force is equal to<br>
                              the weight of the fluid displaced by the body and is called the force of buoyancy or simply buoyancy.<br>
                            <b>  Centre of Buoyancy: </b><br>
                              It is defined as the point, through which the force of buoyancy is supposed to act. As the force of buoyancy is a<br>
                              vertical force and is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body, the centre of buoyancy will be the<br>
                              centre of gravity of the fluid displaced.<br>
                            <b>  Centre of gravity:</b><br>
                              Center of Gravity is the point in a body where the gravitational force may be taken to act.<br>
                            <b>  Meta-centre: </b><br>
                              It is defined as the point about which a body starts oscillating when the body is tilted by a small angle.<br>
                              The meta-centre may also be defined as the point at which the line of action of the force of buoyancy will meet the<br>
                              normal axis of the body when the body is given a small angular displacement.<br>

                              The distance between the meta-centre of a floating body and the centre of gravity of the body is called meta-centric<br>
                              height.

                            1.	Stable equilibrium<br>
                            When a body is given a small angular displacement, i.e. it is tilted slightly by some external force and then it<br>
                            returns back to original position due to internal forces. Such equilibrium is called stable equilibrium.<br><br>
                          <b>  2.	Unstable equilibrium</b><br>
                            If a body does not return to its original position from the slightly displaced angular position and moves father<br>
                            away when give a small angular displacement such equilibrium is called an unstable equilibrium.<br><br>
                          <b>  3.	Neutral equilibrium</b><br>
                            The body remains at rest in any position to which it may be displaced, no net force tends to return the body to<br>
                            its original state or to drive it further away from the original position, is called neutral equilibrium.<br><br>

                          <br><h3>  Conditions of equilibrium of a floating and submerged bodies:</h3>
                          <br>The stability of a body depends on relative position of centre of buoyancy (B) and centre of gravity(G)<br>


                          <br><b>Stability of a sub-merged body:</b><br><br>
                          Stability of submerged body is determined from relative position of Centre of gravity and centre of buoyancy.
                          <br>The position of centre of gravty and centre of buoyancy in case od sub-merged body are fixed.<br><br>

                          <br><br><b>•	Stable equilibrium-</b><br>
                          <br>A body is said to be in stable equilibrium when FB= W and B is above G. Weight W acts in downward direction
                          <br>while buoyant force act in upward direction. When body is given small displacement in clockwise direction
                          <br>the couple generated due weight and centre of buoyancy tries to rotated the body in anti-clockwise direction
                          <br>and hence body remains stable.<br>

                          <br><b>•	Unstable equilibrium-</b><br>
                          <br>A body is said to be in unstable equilibrium if FB =W and G is above B. When body is in unstable equilibrium
                          <br>it does not regain its initial position under small displacement. If body is given small angular displacement
                          <br>in clockwise direction the couple generated due to weight and centre of buoyancy also tried to rotate the body
                          <br>in same direction which leads to unstable equilibrium.<br>
                          <br><b>•	Neutral equilibrium-</b><br>
                          <br>In case of neutral equilibrium B and G coincides with each other and FB=W. So bothe forces acting at same point
                          <br>in opposite direction nullifies each other’s effect.</b><br>


                          <br><b>Stability of floating body:</b><br>
                          <br>The stability of floating body is determined from position of Metacentre. The relative position of Metacentre
                          <br>and Centre of gravity indicates type of equilibrium. When the body undergoes angular displacement about horizontal
                          <br>axis the shape of submerged volume changes and as result Centre of buoyancy moves relative to the body.<br><br>

                          <br><b>•	Stable equilibrium:</b><br>
                          <br>The floating body will be stable equilibrium if M is above G. If a body is given small angular displacement
                          <br>in clockwise direction amount of water displaced changes and hence centre of buoyancy shifts from B to B1
                          <br>such that the vertical line through B1 at M. Then the buoyant force FB acts through B1 and weight acts through
                          <br>G which constitutes a couple in anti-clockwise direction which brings back the body in initial position.<br>

                         <br><b>•	Unstable equilibrium:</b><br>
                         <br>In case of unstable equilibrium M lies below G. When body is given small angular displacement in clockwise
                         <br>direction the couple generated due to buoyant force and weight W also acts in same direction which overturns the body.<br>

                         <br> <b>•	Neutral equilibrium:</b><br>
                         <br>If Metacentre M is at the centre of gravity G , the body will be in neutral equilibrium.
