                              The Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is
                             subjected to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities. A region where these
                              forces change behavior is known as a boundary layer, such as the bounding surface in the interior
                               of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of high-velocity fluid into
                                a low-velocity fluid, such as the hot gases emitted from a flame in air.
                                 This relative movement generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing turbulent flow.
                                  Counteracting this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which tends to inhibit turbulence.
                                   The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given
                                   flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular situation.

                            This ability to predict the onset of turbulent flow is an important design tool for equipment such
                           as piping systems or aircraft wings, but the Reynolds number is also used in scaling of fluid dynamics
                            problems, and is used to determine dynamic similitude between two different cases of fluid flow,
                             such as between a model aircraft, and its full-size version. Such scaling is not linear and the
                              application of Reynolds numbers to both situations allows scaling factors to be developed.

                            The Reynolds number can be defined for several different situations where a fluid
                            is in relative motion to a surface. These definitions generally include the fluid
                             properties of density and viscosity, plus a velocity and a characteristic length
                             or characteristic dimension (L in the above equation). This dimension is a matter
                             of convention – for example radius and diameter are equally valid to describe spheres
                              or circles, but one is chosen by convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or
                              width can be used. For flow in a pipe, or for a sphere moving in a fluid, the internal
                               diameter is generally used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical
                                objects have an equivalent diameter defined. For fluids of variable density such as
                                 compressible gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as non-Newtonian fluids,
                                  special rules apply. The velocity may also be a matter of convention in some circumstances,
                                   notably stirred vessels.
